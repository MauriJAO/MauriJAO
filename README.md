## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Mauricio Aravena, and I am from Santiago, Chile. I am a professional chemical analyst and have been training in web development for the past two years. I completed two bootcamp courses: Full Stack Python Application Development Trainee (Edutecno) and Front-End Application Development Trainee (Infocal), both offered through SENCE and Talento Digital.

My work experience is in the chemical industry, where my responsibilities focus on delivering results within specified timeframes and ensuring the reliability of the results obtained. I am an enthusiastic person eager to continue developing in the field of web development, contributing a different perspective to make websites more user-friendly.
